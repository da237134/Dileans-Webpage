            <h2 style="font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">Berchie Family</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: cursive;">One great day, when the sun was <mark style="background-color: yellow; color: blue;">shining</mark> and the birds were singing, Claudia was born to John Berchie and Regina Berchie. 2 years later... they had another dauter named <mark style="color:blue; background-color:rgb(214, 20, 240);">Persis</mark>. Then, they decided... <mark style="background-color: red; color: blue;">No More Kids</mark>! Years and Years passed <mark style="background-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgb(243, 243, 46), rgb(23, 246, 182)); color: blue;">(well, it wasn't that long 😏)</mark>  and Claudia got married to Folly Folly-gah and changed her last name. A Few years later, <mark style="background-color: rgb(214, 20, 240); color:blue;">Persis</mark> also got married, but Claudia already had kids! <mark style="background-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgb(240, 158, 172), purple); color: blue;">(Well, only 1️⃣ kid)</mark> she 👧🏾 was named Olivia. Oh, I forgot to mention that <mark style="background-color: rgb(214, 20, 240); color: blue;">Persis</mark> got married to <mark style="background-color:rgb(39, 239, 149); color: blue;">Allan Asaam</mark> which also changed her last name. <mark style="background-color:rgb(39, 239, 149); color: blue;">Allan</mark> loved to play with Olivia. 4 years had passed and Milka was born, <mark style="background-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgb(221, 224, 68), rgb(58, 76, 191)); color:rgb(0, 0, 0)";>(everyone usally calls her Mimi)</mark>. She is always smiling 😁 and laughing. She also likes to tell jokes. I cant tell the diffrence when she is serius. Anyways, were <mark style="background-image:linear-gradient(to right, rgb(236, 117, 145), rgb(255, 43, 43)); color:blue;">almost there</mark>! Claudia and Folly didn't have kids. Until 5 years later, when they had there first son, <mark style="background-color: yellowgreen; color:blue;">Joshua</mark>. He loves to play games all day, but is not able to stay on doing one thing for a period of time. He easily gets bored if he does one thing for a period of time. He also loves to eat all kinds of food 🍟🍕. And Vaniah sometimes likes to call him fat. (you'll see who Vaniah is soon...) Anyway, Allan and <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.568);">Persis</mark> felt left out on having kids, so a year later... they gave birth to... <mark style="background-image:linear-gradient(to left, red, orange, yellow, green, aqua, purple); color: blue;">Me!</mark>They named me Dilean, and I was there first child. 3 years passed and <mark style="background-color: rgb(214, 20, 240);">Persis</mark> saw I was <mark style="background-image:linear-gradient(to left, rgb(81, 81, 201), rgb(36, 21, 250))">lonely 😢</mark>. So she gave birth to my little sister, <mark style="background-color: pink; color:blue;">Vaniah</mark>! Vaniah can be funny and pretty fightsty, she has to sides. She can also cry pretty loud</p>
